# Scientific Training Center for Plant Biotechnologies
## Introdution to Statistical methods for Plant Variety Evaluation - "Beginner" level

Data and scripts for creation and analysis of experimental designs based on Randomized Complete Block design for plant variety evaluation . We are covering:  

1. How simple statisaitcal anayses help in majking decieions for breedin
2. Using R to simply and quickly perform reproducible analsyses
3. 
4. 
5. 

Making the best of your trials is compulsory for sucessful selection of the most promising genotypes, and for performing trials for variety evaluation prior Registration.
