# Scientific Training Center for Plant Biotechnologies
## Introdution to Statistical methods for Plant Variety Evaluation - "Beginner" level

Data and scripts for creation and analysis of experimental designs based on Randomized Complete Block design for plant variety evaluation . We are covering:  

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Making the best of your trials is compulsory for sucessful slection of most promising genotypes, and for preparing trial for varitiety evaluation prior Registration.
